            Now the skies could fall
            Not even if my boss should call
            The world it seems so very small
            'Cause nothin' even matters, at all
            
            See nothin' even matters
            See nothin' even matters at all
            Nothin' even matters
            Nothin' even matters at all
            
            See, I don't need no alcohol
            Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
            Without it, I'd go through withdrawal
            'Cause nothin' even matters at all
            
            Nothin' even matters
            Nothin' even matters at all
            Nothin' even matters
            Nothin' even matters at all
            
            These buildings could drift out to sea
            Some natural catastrophe
            Still there's no place I'd rather be
            'Cause nothin' even matters to me
            
            See nothin' even matters
            See nothin' even matters to me
            Nothin' even matters
            Nothin' even matters to me
            
            You're part of my identity
            I sometimes have the tendency
            To look at you religiously, baby
            'Cause nothin' even matters to me
            
            Nothin' even matters
            Nothin' even matters to me
            Said I don't, my baby, baby
            
            Now you won't find me at no store
            I have no time for manicures
            With you it's never either or
            'Cause nothin' even matters no more
            
            See nothin', it don't matters
            See nothin' even matters no more
            Nothin' even matters
            Nothin' even matters no more
            
            Now my team could score
            And make it to the final four
            Just repossess my 4 x 4
            'Cause nothin' even matters no more
            
            Nothin' even matters
            Nothin' even matters no more
            Nothin' even matters, oh oh oh
            
            To me, to me, to me, to me, to me
            To me, to me, to me, to me, to me
            
            Nothing even matters
            Nothing even matters no more
            Nothing even matters
            Nothing even matters
            
            Nothing but you
            Nothing but you
            Nothing but you

              <p>In this app, the focus was on ensuring people with disabilities can access the Horiseon website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and a special keyboard. 
                Making this website accessible may also help position it better in Google search engines . 
                <br>
                <br>
                In hopes of making my clients approving of my services, I also improved the codebase and  reworked their previous file structure to make it more efficient, 
                including comments before each element or section of the page. </p>

              <h4 class="design-type">Wedsite Design</h4>
              <p>Working with the Run Buddy team was an exciting; making the project fun to work on.  I was albe to stretch my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
                The Run Buddy had very specific criteria for this project.  We added a form to the Reach Out section, so that users can submit questions directly to the sales staff.  
                I also made updates for Hero Section to include inspirational message to connect with the community.
                <br>
                <br>
                This project is version 2.0 for this company and  includes some subtle visual changes like rounded corners on the forms. 
                A few other changes reveal themselves as the user interacts with the page.   The customer seemd please with the work and this has been the main focus all along.
